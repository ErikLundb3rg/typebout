## About
TypeBout is a typeracing website in which you can challenge your friends in typing speed. TypeBout attempts to create a smooth, seamless experience when typing and provides direct feedback on typos and input. Accounts are also supported, in which you can view your typing history and track your progress.  



More features are on the way, and as TypeBout is in its infancy you might find a bug or two.

## Technical
Using Next js 13, the frontend is written in Typescript and uses Chakra-ui for components and layout. The backend is also written in Typescript and uses Node, Express, Prisma-io and PostgreSQL. Authentication is handled using JWT. 

To run the project and learn more, see the respective README's for frontend and backend subfolders.
